# selenium_test_scraper

This is a repository where I've decided to dump some my web scraping scripts so that I can refer to them collectively as a "project,"
although this isn't really one discrete project.

These scripts could be valuable for putting together an Eijiro- or a Linguee-style dictionary for one's own personal use (e.g.,
as a translator or language learner), although the outputs aren't specifically formatted for that purpose. The scripts output txt
files because I usually just search their contents with grep, etc.

## SciAm_Parallel_Texts_Scraper.py

Scrapes sample Scientific American article excerpts and their translations from the Nikkei Science website.
