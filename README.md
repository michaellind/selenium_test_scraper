# selenium_test_scraper

This is a repository where I've decided to dump some my web scraping scripts so that I can refer to them collectively as a "project,"
although this isn't really one discrete project.

These scripts could be valuable for putting together an Eijiro- or a Linguee-style dictionary for one's own personal use.
